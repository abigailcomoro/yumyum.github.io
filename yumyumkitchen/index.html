        <h2>Baklava</h2>
        <p>Flaky, crispy and not overly sweet. Baklava is a layered dessert made of filo pastry sheets, filled with chopped nuts, and sweetened with syrup or honey. You will love the hint of mellow lemony flavor which offsets the sweetness and compliments the cinnamon. The chocolate is optional but a nice touch to fancy up a tray of baklava. <a href="baklavarecipe.html">Go to recipe.</a></p>
